Project: Human Detection in Disaster Zones Using Drones and YOLOv3
This project aims to develop a drone-based solution for detecting humans trapped under debris following natural disasters or building collapses. Leveraging drone technology and the YOLOv3 algorithm, this system facilitates rapid human detection in challenging environments where traditional search and rescue methods may be difficult.

The main components of the project are as follows:

Drone Technology: Drones are equipped with cameras and sensors to survey disaster zones efficiently. Their agility and ability to access difficult-to-reach areas make them ideal for search and rescue operations.

Human Detection with YOLOv3: The YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) algorithm is employed for real-time human detection. This deep learning model is known for its high accuracy and speed, allowing it to identify humans even in cluttered or low-visibility conditions.

Objectives:

Rapid and accurate human detection in disaster-hit areas.
Real-time image processing and detection to aid in swift rescue operations.
Autonomous navigation of drones for coverage of large areas.
Through this project, we aim to significantly enhance the effectiveness of search and rescue efforts by reducing response times and improving human detection accuracy in disaster zones.
