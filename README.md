# AI-BASED-DRONES
Problem:
Disasters serve as an eye-opener as they are unstoppable and exceptional events which are either natural or manmade, 	such as earthquakes, wildfires, floods and terrorist attacks etc. These natural catastrophes many a times serve as a hats   	down chink in 	the armor as they lead to a massive death toll either 	because of people being stuck in the debris or due to 	no 	help received on time. One of the major challenges faced by  the rescue and search teams during a massive 	disaster is the 	actual search of survivors and victims at the earliest 	and also 	reaching out to far off areas to make sure 	people are not stuck under the debris.
Solution:
The solution presented is an autonomous drone using the YOLO v3 algorithm for real-time human detection in disasters, which alerts rescue teams to the victims' precise locations, enhancing search and rescue efficiency
